# The Yuppie Renter

Here we have a `rent?` method that decides if we are going to an apartment based on some information about it.

Firstly, We only want to rent it if it's baller (whatever that means!). Furthermore, we only want it if it's furnished but are willing to make an exception if it's rent is cheaper than 2100 per month (Ugh...Downtown Vancouver prices!)

### Steps:
1. Write test code by outputting the return values for possible permutations of this method (at the bottom of this file)
2. Based on the actual behavior (vs desired behavior), can you determine what the (buggy) logic is ACTUALLY checking?
3. Having identified what is actually occurring vs what should occur, fix the bug such that the logic works as desired.
4. Compare and discuss your solution (fix) with your peers. This includes your test cases. Did you cover all the possibilities? Did you have the same solution? Whose is better and why?
5. How can you reduce the body/contents of this method down to one line? Effectively making it much simpler and cleaner. Do it!
